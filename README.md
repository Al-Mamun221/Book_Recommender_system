A Book Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

BookWise is a machine learning-based book recommendation system that suggests similar books based on user-selected input. It uses collaborative filtering (KNN) to find similar titles from a dataset of books and displays them with cover images in a user-friendly Gradio interface. The system also includes filter options like “Top 50 Rated” and “Top 50 Trending” to help users explore popular titles easily.
